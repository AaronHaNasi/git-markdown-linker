# Github Markdown Linker

The idea of this project came from me storing all my D&D 5e campaign notes as
markdown files, and realizing I can link the files to eachother in the same way
a webpage does, like wikipedia, linking names and terms to their relevant files
to create a pseudo wiki. 

The python file takes two arguments, a term to search for in markdown files and
link to a specific file, and the specific file you want the term linked to.
